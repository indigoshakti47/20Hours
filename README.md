# 20Hours App

This project demonstrates automatic deployment to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**.

Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the workflow located at `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` builds the `index.html` file and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

After pushing your changes to GitHub, the website will be available at:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/20Hours/
```

Replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.
